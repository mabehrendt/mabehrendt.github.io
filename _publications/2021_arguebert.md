Argumentation is an important tool within human interaction, not only in law and politics but also for discussing issues, expressing and exchanging opinions and coming to decisions in our everyday life. Applications for argumentation often require the measurement of the arguments’ similarity, to solve tasks like clustering, paraphrase identification or summarization. In our work, BERT embeddings are pre-trained on novel training objectives and afterwards fine-tuned in a siamese architecture, similar to Reimers and Gurevych (2019b), to measure the similarity of arguments. The experiments conducted in our work show that a change in BERT’s pre-training process can improve the performance on measuring argument similarity.
