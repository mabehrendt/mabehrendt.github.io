title: "How algorithmically curated online environments influence users’ political polarization: Results from two experiments with panel data"

excerpt: 'Social media platforms are often accused of disproportionally exposing their users to like-minded opinions,
thereby fueling political polarization. However, empirical evidence of this causal relationship is inconsistent at
best. One reason could be that many previous studies were unable to separate the effects caused by individual
exposure to like-minded content from the effects caused by the algorithms themselves. This study presents results
from two quasi-experiments in which participants were exposed either to algorithmically selected or randomly
selected arguments that were either in line or in contrast with their attitudes on two different topics. The results
reveal that exposure to like-minded arguments increased participants’ attitude polarization and affective po­
larization more intensely than exposure to opposing arguments. Yet, contrary to popular expectations, these
effects were not amplified by algorithmic selection. Still, for one topic, exposure to algorithmically selected
arguments led to slightly stronger attitude polarization than randomly selected arguments.'
